# Molecular Visualization Tutorials

## 1. Visualization Software
There are many molecular visualization software out there which are useful
for different purposes (visualizing proteins, crystals, trajectories, ...).
I will mainly focus on the ones I know and like to use as long as they are
open-source and cross-platform.

Mercury
Avogadro
Vesta
VMD

Blender
Inkscape
GIMP

## 2. Visualizing a Molecule

- Getting atomic coordinates for a molecule
- Different chemical formats
  - Gotchas
  - Fixing problems with text editor
- Visualizing a molecule
  - Customizing visualization
- Saving image
  - Screenshot
  - Export
  - Transparent background

## 3. Visualizing Larger Molecular Systems

Proteins
Crystals
  - Packing / extending

## 4. Basic Geometric Operations w/ Angstrom

Translating molecules
Rotating molecules
Aligning molecules
Creating a movie

Ex 1: Align nanocar on metal surface
Ex 2: Generate a rotating molecule trajectory and create a movie

## 5. Automating Molecular Visualization w/ Angstrom

Visualizing a list of conformers:
- Generate list of conformers for given molecule
- Write a for loop to visualize list of molecules

Visualize list of crystals:
- Pack each crystal according to certain size
- Render image for each crystal direction

## 6. Molecular Visualization for Web
